PostScript/Graph/Stock version 0.02
===================================

This is a top level module in the PostScript::Graph series.  It produces graphs
of stock price performance from CSV files.  It is possible to download suitable
files direct from finance.yahoo.com for example.

The output files from Finance::Shares::MySQL are also directly compatable.

It would be used as follows:
    (a) Create a PostScript::Graph::XY object using the defaults or any of over
	140 options.
    
    (b) Use the data_from_file() method to read graph data from a CSV file.
    
    (c) Call build_chart() to assemble the postscript code which draws the graph.
    
    (d) Use the output() method to save the postscript file.
