PostScript/Graph/Stock
======================

This is a top level module in the PostScript::Graph series.  It produces graphs
of stock price performance from CSV files.  It is possible to download suitable
files direct from finance.yahoo.com for example.

The output files from Finance::Shares::MySQL are also directly compatable.

It would be used as follows:
    (a) Create a PostScript::Graph::Stock object using the defaults or any of over
	140 options including 'source' which sets where the data will be drawn from.
   
    (b) Superimpose any additional lines onto the price, analysis or volume charts.
   
    (c) Use the output() method to save the postscript file.
